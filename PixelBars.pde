//Ok, so I found this code to create pixelated-looking rectangles, and I really wanted to
///use it in this project, behind the large Poem Field No.2 letters to give it the same look of movement
//that it has in the film, but I couldn't get it to work without overworking the program till it literally quits
//but I wanted to put it here, just so that you could see I wanted to use it

//void draw(){
//fill(255);
//  smooth();
//  for (int i =10;i<width; i+=10) {
   
//  };
//  noStroke();
//  for (int i =0;i<width; i+=40) {
//fill(200,0,random(1,200), 100);
//    rect(i, 160, 40, 40);
//    fill(200,0,random(100, 200),100);
//    rect(i, 200, 40, 40);
//    fill(190,0, random(170, 255), 100);
//    rect(i, 240, 40, 40);
//  }
